# Habit-Tracker-Bot
The Habit Tracker Bot is your personal assistant for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and achieving personal goals. With this bot, you can easily add, remove, and manage your habits, and receive reminders at your preferred times. Use the /add_habit command to add a new habit by specifying the habit name, day of the week (where 0 is Monday and 6 is Sunday), and time in HH:MM format. For example, /add_habit Morning Run, 0, 07:00. To remove a habit, use the /remove_habit command, which will present you with a list of your habits with buttons to select the one you want to delete or cancel the operation. The bot will automatically remind you to perform your habits at the specified time, helping you stay on track with your daily routine. All interactions are handled through simple commands and buttons, making the bot user-friendly and intuitive. The Habit Tracker Bot uses a database to store your habits, ensuring that your data is preserved even after the bot is restarted. Your habits will be automatically loaded, and reminders will continue to function as intended.
